	    <p>This page uses custom home page request mapper. Loading http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples/mappers/ automatically appends
	    a preconfigured locale: http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples/mappers/en_US</p>

		    <a href="de/localized">de Localized</a>
	    </wicket:link>
	    
	    <p>Clicking to any of the links above will lead to a page mounted at "localized" path but the session locale will be automatically set
	    depending on the locale in the url. I.e. loading http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples/mappers/bg_BG/localized will show the page with 
	    text localized in Bulgarian.</p>
