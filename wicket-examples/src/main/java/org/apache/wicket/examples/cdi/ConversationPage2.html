		This page was reached via a non-bookmarkable link so conversation was propagated. 
		Notice the conversational counter injected into this page has the same value as in the 
		previous page, this is because it is the same counter instance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 'Continue to next page' link below is a bookmarkable link. Conversations do not propagate
		across bookmarkable links, so the counter on the next page will have the starting value of zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		Current counter value is: <span wicket:id="count">100</span>
		<a wicket:id="increment">increment</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a wicket:id="next">Continue to next page</a>
