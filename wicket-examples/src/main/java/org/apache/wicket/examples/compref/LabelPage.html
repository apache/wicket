	<h1>wicket.markup.html.basic.Label</h1>
	<wicket:link><a href="Index.html">[back to the reference]</a></wicket:link>

	<p>
	You use a label to display strings on your page.
	</p>

	<p>
	A static label just prints out the text you fed it:<br />

	<span wicket:id="staticLabel" class="mark">this text will be replaced</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	Actually, each label has an instance of IModel backing it. This means
	we can create dynamic labels, like this label that prints out the current date/time.<br />

	<span wicket:id="dynamicLabel" class="mark">this text will be replaced</span>

	<br />One of the first things you probably noticed, is that the date is nicely formatted,
	hopefully even in your locale's format. This is because Wicket works with converters.
	Converters are fully customizable and allow you to do any mapping of incomming request
	parameters (from text), and outgoing display values (to text). Usually you won't need to
	bother with converters yourself. Wicket comes with sensible defaults.
	</p>

	<p>
	A lot of times, you want to get the actual text from some other location, like a
	resource bundle:<br />

	<span wicket:id="resourceLabel" class="mark">this text will be replaced</span>

	<br />In this case, the actual display text will be loaded from resource bundle
	'LabelPage.properties', and {0} will be replaced with the locale argument we fed it.
	</p>

	<p>
	Normally, markup characters will be escaped for you in order to prevent all kinds of
	troubles/ mess up attempts. However in this example, we actually want any markup to be
	interpreted by the browser<br />

	<span wicket:id="markupLabel" class="mark">this text will be replaced</span>
	</p>

	<span wicket:id="explainPanel">panel contents come here</span>
