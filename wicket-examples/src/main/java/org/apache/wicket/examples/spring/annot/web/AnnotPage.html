<b>Annotations and Bean Proxy Approach</b><br/>
This approach allows users to quickly and easily inject any component with bean proxies. Components simply have to annotate any fields they wish injected with @SpringBean annotation.
Interesting classes:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>SpringComponentInjector - an implementation of . that performs the injection</li>
	<li>AnnotPage - contains an annotated field whose value will be initialized with a proxy by the injector</li>
</ul>
