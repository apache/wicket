	This page is bookmarkable. Users can navigate to this page from anywhere (hence they
	can even bookmark it), and a user doesn't have to be in a session prior to addressing
	a bookmarkable page (though a session will be created right away).

	The message beneath is either the message that was passed as a PageParameters argument (which
	maps directly to a request parameter) or the default message. <br />
