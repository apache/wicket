		<h2>Below there are three types of videos to show the basic functionality of Wicket's media implementation</h2>
		<h3>The implementation features full support of video / audio / source / track tags.</h3>
		<div>
			<!-- Video 1 -->
			<video wicket:id="video1" ></video>
			<div class="videoDescription"><b>Video1</b><br/>Demonstrate the basic set of methods to configure a video (setAutoplay(false); setControls(true); setLooping(false); setWidth(320); setHeight(240);) The width and height are null by default which means that the video is going to be rendered in size of the media file. The PackageResourceReference is set to readBuffered(false) which means that the media file is not stored in memory.</div>
			<div class="clearer"></div>
	
			<!-- Video 2 -->
			<video wicket:id="video2" >
				<source wicket:id="source2" />
			</video>
			<div class="videoDescription"><b>Video2</b><br/>This video is rendered with a source tag. You can add many source tags and apply a media query (setMedia(query);) so that based on the resolution different videos are going to be displayed.</div>
			<div class="clearer"></div>
	
			<!-- Video 3 -->
			<video wicket:id="video3" ></video>
			<div class="videoDescription"><b>Video3</b><br/>The last sample shows a remote video located here: https://w3c-test.org/media/movie_300.mp4. It can be added by set the url as String instead of adding a ResourceReference.</div>
