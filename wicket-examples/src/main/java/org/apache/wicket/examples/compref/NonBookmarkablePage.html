	This page is private/ non bookmarkable. There is no way for any user to navigate to this
	page directly like it is possible with bookmarkable pages.
	</p>
	<p>
	When navigating to this page, we passed the page that we came from as an argument. This
	page holds that as a variable, and uses it to navigate back to it when the user clicks
	the link beneath. Everytime a page is rendered, it is put in front of the list of pages
	that is in the session.
