	<p>
	You can view Borders as kind of the opposite of Panels. You use Borders to
	<i>decorate other components/ markup</i>. This allows you to combine loosely coupled
	components into larger blocks. An example of this is the FormComponentFeedbackBorder
	components that you can put <i>around</i> e.g. input fields (TextField) so that
	when there was a validation error for that field on a form submit, the border
	displays its' red star marker as a hint to the user.
	</p>
	<p>You can also use Borders for templating techniques much the same as you can
	use markup inheritance. See the library example for an example of that usage.
	Like Panels, you can nest arbitrairy components in a Border, including other
	panels and borders.
