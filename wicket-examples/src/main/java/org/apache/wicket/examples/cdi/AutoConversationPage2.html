		This page is not marked with ConversationalComponent. Therefore, the conversation that was
		started on the previous page is ended. Notice the conversational counter injected into this
		page initially has the same value as in the	previous page, this is because the conversation
		was still active in the request that rendered this page. However, clicking 'refresh' below,
		will reset the counter to 0.
	</p>
	<p>
		Current counter value is: <span wicket:id="count">100</span>
		<a wicket:id="refresh">refresh</a>
