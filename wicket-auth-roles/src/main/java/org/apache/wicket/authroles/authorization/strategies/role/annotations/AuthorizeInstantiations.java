/**
 * Groups a set (technically an array) of {@link AuthorizeInstantiation}s for page authorization.
 * 
 * This offers the ability to instantiate a page based on combined permissions / roles required. It
 * represents an AND relationship between the included permissions / roles.
 * 
 * This can be used like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;AuthorizeInstantiations(ruleset = { &#064;AuthorizeInstantiation(&quot;ADMIN&quot;),
 * 		&#064;AuthorizeInstantiation(&quot;MANAGER&quot;) })
 * public class ForAdministrativeManagers extends WebPage

 * 	{
