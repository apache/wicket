<p>
Package for working with bread crumb components.
</p>
<p>
  Bread crumbs provide a means to track certain history of client actions.
  Bread crumbs are typically rendered as a list of links, and are useful when
  users 'dig deeper' into the site structure so that they can find their way
  back again and have a notion of where they currently are.
</p>
<p>
  Bread crumbs in the original sense just represent where people are in a site
  hierarchy. For example, when browsing a product site, bread crumbs could look
  like this:
  
  <pre>
           Home &gt; Products &amp; Solutions &gt; Hardware &gt; Desktop Systems
  </pre>
  
  or
  
  <pre>
           World &gt; Europe &gt; The Netherlands &gt; Utrecht
  </pre>
  
  These items would be rendered as links to the corresponding site location.
</p>
<p>
 The central interface of this package is <tt>IBreadCrumbModel</tt>, which models the concept of bread crumbs.
 The main implementation of bread crumbs is the <tt>BreadCrumbBar</tt>, which is a Wicket component
 that renders the bread crumbs and an implementation of <tt>IBreadCrumbModel</tt> in one.
