/**
 * Class for request related settings
 * <p>
 * <i>bufferResponse </i> (defaults to true) - True if the application should buffer responses. This
 * does require some additional memory, but helps keep exception displays accurate because the whole
 * rendering process completes before the page is sent to the user, thus aRequestCycleSettingsing the possibility of
 * a partially rendered page.
 * <p>
 * <i>renderStrategy </i>- Sets in what way the render part of a request is handled. Basically,
 * there are two different options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Direct, IRequestCycleSettings.RenderStrategy.ONE_PASS_RENDER. Everything is handled in one
 * physical request. This is efficient, and is the best option if you want to do sophisticated
 * clustering. It does not however, shield you from what is commonly known as the <i>Double submit
 * problem </i></li>
 * <li>Using a redirect. This follows the pattern <a
 * href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=RedirectAfterPost" >as described at the
 * serverside </a> and that is commonly known as Redirect after post. Wicket takes it one step
 * further to do any rendering after a redirect, so that not only form submits are shielded from the
 * double submit problem, but also the IRequestListener handlers (that could be e.g. a link that
 * deletes a row). With this pattern, you have two options to choose from:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IRequestCycleSettings.RenderStrategy.REDIRECT_TO_RENDER. This option first handles the
 * 'action' part of the request, which is either page construction (bookmarkable pages or the home
 * page) or calling a IRequestListener handler, such as Link.onClick. When that part is done, a
 * redirect is issued to the render part, which does all the rendering of the page and its
 * components. <strong>Be aware </strong> that this may mean, depending on whether you access any
 * models in the action part of the request, that attachment and detachment of some models is done
 * twice for a request.</li>
 * <li>IRequestCycleSettings.RenderStrategy.REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER. This option handles both the action-
 * and the render part of the request in one physical request, but instead of streaming the result
 * to the browser directly, it is kept in memory, and a redirect is issued to get this buffered
 * result (after which it is immediately removed). This option currently is the default render
 * strategy, as it shields you from the double submit problem, while being more efficient and less
 * error prone regarding to detachable models.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note: In rare cases the strategies involving redirect may lose session data! For example: if
 * after the first phase of the strategy the server node fails without having the chance to
 * replicate the session then the second phase will be executed on another node and the whole
 * process will be restarted and thus anything stored in the first phase will be lost with the
 * failure of the server node. For similar reasons it is recommended to use sticky sessions when
 * using redirect strategies.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * More documentation is available about each setting in the setter method for the property.

		 * The render part of a request (opposed to the 'action part' which is either the
		 * construction of a bookmarkable page or the execution of a IRequestListener handler) is
		 * handled by a separate request by issuing a redirect request to the browser. This is
		 * commonly known as the 'redirect after submit' pattern, though in our case, we use it for
		 * GET and POST requests instead of just the POST requests.
		 * <p>
		 * This pattern solves the 'refresh' problem. While it is a common feature of browsers to
		 * refresh/ reload a web page, this results in problems in many dynamic web applications.
		 * For example, when you have a link with an event handler that e.g. deletes a row from a
		 * list, you usually want to ignore refresh requests after that link is clicked on. By using
		 * this strategy, the refresh request only results in the re-rendering of the page without
		 * executing the event handler again.
		 * </p>
		 * <p>
		 * Though it solves the refresh problem, it introduces potential problems, as the request
		 * that is logically one, are actually two separate request. Not only is this less
		 * efficient, but this also can mean that within the same request attachment/ detachment of
		 * models is done twice (in case you use models in the bookmarkable page constructors and
		 * IRequestListener handlers). If you use this strategy, you should be aware of this
		 * possibility, and should also be aware that for one logical request, actually two
		 * instances of RequestCycle are created and processed.
		 * </p>
		 * <p>
		 * Also, even with this strategy set, it is ignored for instances of
		 * {@link org.apache.wicket.core.request.handler.BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestHandler},
		 * because otherwise they wouldn't be bookmarkable.
