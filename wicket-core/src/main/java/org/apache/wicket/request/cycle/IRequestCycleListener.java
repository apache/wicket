/**
 * A callback interface for various methods in the request cycle. If you are creating a framework
 * that needs to do something in this methods, rather than extending RequestCycle or one of its
 * subclasses, you should implement this callback and allow users to add your listener to their
 * custom request cycle.
 * <p>
 * These listeners can be added directly to the request cycle when it is created or to the
 * {@link Application}.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: a listener implementation is a singleton and hence needs to ensure proper handling
 * of multi-threading issues.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Call order</h3>
 * <p>
 * The interface methods are ordered in the execution order as Wicket goes through the request
 * cycle:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #onBeginRequest(RequestCycle)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onEndRequest(RequestCycle)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onDetach(RequestCycle)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The previous call sequence is valid for any Wicket request passing through the Wicket filter.
 * Additionally when a request handler was resolved, a new handler scheduled, or an unhandled
 * exception occurred during the request processing, any of the following can be called:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onRequestHandlerResolved(RequestCycle, org.apache.wicket.request.IRequestHandler)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onRequestHandlerScheduled(RequestCycle, org.apache.wicket.request.IRequestHandler)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onException(RequestCycle, Exception)}, followed by
 * {@link #onExceptionRequestHandlerResolved(RequestCycle, org.apache.wicket.request.IRequestHandler, Exception)} </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Implementing your own</h3>
 * <p>
 * Use {@link AbstractRequestCycleListener} for a default, empty implementation as a base class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 * <p>
 * A short example of a request counter.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class RequestCounter extends AbstractRequestCycleListener
 * {
 * 	private AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0);
 * 
 * 	public void onBeginRequest(RequestCycle cycle)
 * 	{
 * 		counter.incrementAndGet();
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public long getRequestCount()
 * 	{
 * 		return counter.longValue();
 * 	}
 * }
 * 
 * public class MyApplication extends WebApplication
 * {
 * 	public void init()
 * 	{
 * 		super.init();
 * 		getRequestCycleListeners().add(new RequestCounter());
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
