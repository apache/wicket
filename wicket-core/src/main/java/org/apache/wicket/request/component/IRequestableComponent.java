	 * If the model was constructed thusly, which is quite common: {@code new PropertyModel(this,
	 * "person")} and {@link Component} implemented {@link IDetachable} then calling @{code
	 * model.detach()} will cause an infinite loop with the model trying to detach the component and
	 * the component trying to detach the model.
