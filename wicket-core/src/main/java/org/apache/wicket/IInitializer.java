/**
 * Initializes something when application loads.
 * <p>
 * Initializer can be used for clustering. Lets say you access a page that has a link to a resource on
 * node A now the url for the resource gets forwarded to node B, but node B doesn't have the
 * resource registered yet because maybe the page class hasn't been loaded and so its static block
 * hasn't run yet. So the initializer is a place for you to register all those resources and do all
 * the stuff you used to do in the static blocks.
 * <p>
 * You don't have to pre-register {@link PackageResource package resources}, as they can be
 * initialized lazily.
 * <p>
 * Initializers can be configured via {@link ServiceLoader}, i.e. by having a file
 * /META-INF/services/org.apache.wicket.IInitializer in the class path root, with each line containing the
 * full class name of an {@link IInitializer}.
