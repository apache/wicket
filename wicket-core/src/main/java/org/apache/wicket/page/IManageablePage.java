	 * Sets whether or not the page is allowed to change its page id. Implementations of this
	 * interface usually change their page id once a change to the data structure is made and

	 * back button). Keeping a historical record is usually achieved by simply incrementing the page
	 * id to the next unique number, so when the implementation is stored it is done so in a new
	 * slot.
	 * 
	 * This method is useful when for some reason we do not want the implementation to change its
	 * page id under any circumstances. One concrete example is an AJAX request. Suppose the page
	 * with id 10 was written out with callbacks pointing to id 10. Suppose that the user executed
	 * some AJAX callbacks which have changed the page id to 15. Now, the user clicks a non-AJAX
	 * link that was never updated by an AJAX update and still points to id 10 - which causes the
	 * state of the page to be rolled back - which is usually undesirable as all changes made to the
	 * page by AJAX requests are lost. So, instead, whatever is invoking the execution of the AJAX
	 * request on the page can use this method to tell the page to not update its page id thereby
	 * solving the problem.
