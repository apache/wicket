/**
 * <code>&lt;wicket:enclosure&gt;</code> is nice and prevents that users have to add boilerplate to
 * their application. But it is not without problems. The child components are children in the
 * markup, but the auto-component generated for the enclosure tag will not magically re-parent the
 * child components. Thus the markup hierarchy and the component hierarchy will be out of sync. The
 * automatically created enclosure container will be created along side its "children" with both
 * attached to the very same parent container. That leads to a tricky situation since e.g.
 * <code>onBeforeRender()</code> will be called for enclosure children even if the enclosure is made
 * invisible by it controlling child.
 * <p>
 * On top auto-components cannot keep any state. A new instance is created during each render
 * process and automatically deleted at the end. That implies that we cannot prevent
 * <code>validation()</code> from being called, since validation() is called before the actual
 * render process has started.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Where any of these problems apply, you may replace the tag and manually add this simple container
 * which basically does the same. But instead of adding the children to the Page, Panel whatever,
 * you must add the children to this container in order to keep the component hierarchy in sync.
 * </p>
