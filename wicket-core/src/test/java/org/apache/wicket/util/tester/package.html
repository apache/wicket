		<p>
			A package with utility classes to ease unit testing of Wicket applications without the need for 
			a servlet container. The only classes required by users to test are <code>WicketTester</code> 
			and <code>FormTester</code>. <code>WicketTester</code> extends <code>MockWebApplication</code> 
			and extends it with convenience methods to start (render) a page and to test (assert) 
			certain conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>FormTester</code> is a utility class to make unit testing an HTML form a breeze.
