		<section name="Running the Examples from Source">
			<p>
				The process for running the the examples from source is quite simple. We have
				supplied an embedded application server 
				(<a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org" title="Jetty Java HTTP Servlet Server">Jetty</a>) which
				can be run directly from your IDE. Note that you are not obligated to use the embedded 
				server; you can compile and deploy to any application server of your liking.
			</p>
			<p>
				The steps for deploying and running the examples from the source distribution can be outlined
				as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Download the distribution</li>
				<li>Unpack the distribution to your workspace</li>
				<li>Create the <code>war</code> archive</li>
				<li>Deploy and run the examples</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following sections will elaborate these steps further.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Download the Distribution">
				<p>
					In order to build the examples from the distribution you need to
					<a
						href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783&amp;package_id=138752">
						download the latest distribution
					</a>
					from a mirror close to you. After the download you have to unpack
					the archive which will give you
					<ul>
						<li>a directory containing all necessary libraries</li>
						<li>a directory containing all sources, including a Jetty configuration file</li>
						<li>a directory containing some basic documentation.</li>
						<li>an ant build file</li>
						<li>a maven project file</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Integrate into your Workspace">
				<p>
					Copy this directory structure to your workspace and update your IDE to use this directory as a project.
					For instance, you could instruct the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> 'New Java project' wizard
					to create a project in the directory of the Wicket examples. Let Eclipse figure out what the source 
					directories are and which libraries are needed on the classpath.
				</p>
				<p>
					For other IDE's your milage may vary. Just make sure that you do the following:
					<ul>
					<li>add all jar files in the <code>lib</code> directory to the classpath</li>
					<li>add the <code>src/java</code> directory as a source directory</li>
					<li>compile the sources using your IDE, or using the supplied ant build file</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Running the Examples">
				<p>
					Try to find the <code>wicket.examples.Start</code> class in your IDE.
					This class has a <code>main()</code> method which starts the embedded server. Run this
					class.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Eclipse, you can just select the <code>src/java</code> directory, and select <code>'Run as -&gt; Java application'</code>
					in order to run the examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only thing you *really* need to take care of is making sure no other application server is
					using port 8080, otherwise the embedded application server is not able to start. If you are not
					able to stop the other application server, you might consider changing the port setting in the
					<code>src/etc/jetty-config.xml</code> file to another port number.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the only thing left to do is pointing your browser to:
				</p>
				<source>
					<a href="http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples" title="The Wicket Examples running on your machine">http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples</a>
				</source>
