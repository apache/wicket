<title>Wicket Bean Validation Package</title>
</head>
<body>

	<p>This package integrates bean validation framework into Wicket.</p>

	<p>The integration is configured using BeanValidationConfiguration.
		Usually this is done in Application's init method. Once the
		configuration is intialized and customized, the final step is to call
		configure passing in the application instance to be configured.</p>

	<p>The configuration can be customized using the following
		integration points:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>IPropertyResolver</code> - used to automatically figure
			out which property is being validated given the form component
			instance. By default all components using an
			IPropertyReflectionAwareModel are supported.</li>
		<li><code>IViolationTranslator</code> - converts bean validation
			constraint violations to Wicket validation errors that are reported
			on form components when validation fails.</li>
		<li><code>ITagModifier</code> - An object that can modify the
			form component's markup tag. Can be used to add html attributes to
			tags based on constaint annotations.</li>
		<li><code>Provider&lt;Validator&gt;</code> - used as a factory
			for the main Validator object instance that will be used to perform
			the validation</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once the application is configured form components can be
		validated by adding a PropertyValidator.</p>
