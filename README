Apache Wicket 6.0
=================

This is the readme file for the Apache Wicket project. 

Apache Wicket is an open source, java, component based, web application
framework. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a
refreshing lack of XML, Apache Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and
enjoyable again. Swap the boilerplate, complex debugging and brittle code for
powerful, reusable components written with plain Java and HTML.

Apache Wicket can be found at: http://wicket.apache.org and is licensed under
the Apache Software Foundation license, version 2.0.

Wicket is distributed under the terms of the Apache Software Foundation
license, version 2.0. The text is included in the file LICENSE in the root
of the project.

Java/Application server requirements
------------------------------------

Wicket requires at least Java 1.6. The application server for running your web
application should adhere to the servlet specification version 2.5 or newer.
Note that your Wicket application might run on containers based on servlet
specification 2.4, but there are no guarantees.

What is in this package
-----------------------

The archive you just downloaded and unpacked contains the source code and the
jars of the core projects of Wicket. If you are just starting out, you
probably only need to include wicket-x.jar, where x stands for the version. As
a rule, use just the jars you need.

You will find the source code here:

Here is a list of projects in this distribution and what they do.

 - wicket: the core project, includes the framework and basic components;
 - wicket-extensions: contains utilities and more specialized components;
 - wicket-auth-roles: a basic authorization package based on roles;
 - wicket-datetime: contains date/ time specific components such as a date
   picker;
 - wicket-jmx: registers JMX beans for managing things like your Wicket 
   configuration and markup cache;
 - wicket-objectssizeof-agent: utility for making better estimates of object 
   sizes in the JVM - most people probably never need this;
 - wicket-ioc: base project for IoC (aka DI) implementations such as 
   Spring and Guice;
 - wicket-spring: support project for using Spring with Wicket and including 
   Spring managed dependencies through using @SpringBean annotations;
 - wicket-guice: support project for using Google Guice with Wicket;
 - wicket-velocity: contains special components for rendering Velocity
   templates using Wicket components - most people probably don't need this,
   but it can be neat when you want to do CMS-like things;
 - wicket-examples: contains a basic component reference and many examples of 
   how to use Wicket and Wicket components, including examples for sub 
   projects such as wicket-spring, wicket-velocity and wicket-auth-roles.
 - wicket-devutils: provides small utilities which can help in development
   phase

Getting started
---------------

The Wicket project has several projects where you can learn from, and get
started quickly:

 - wicket-examples:

    shows all components in short usage examples, also available live on:
    http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples

 - wicket-quickstart archetype:

    provides a skeleton project for use in NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
    and other major IDE's, without having to configure anything yourself. You
    can copy'n'paste the examples from the website into your pages and see
    them running on your own box.

 - AppFuse light - Wicket edition (https://appfuse-light.dev.java.net/)

    AppFuse Light is a can all do it all quickstart setup for almost all
    possible permutations for building Java web applications and ORM
    technologies. It features over 60 downloads and combines each available
    web application framework with Hibernate, iBatis, JDO (JPOX), OJB and
    Spring JDBC.

Dependencies
------------

The easiest way of getting the dependencies of your Wicket based projects
right is to use Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org) with your projects and
include the wicket dependencies you want is outlined in the wicket-quickstart.
Maven will then take care of including the appropriate dependencies.

If you do not want to use maven, here is a break down of the dependencies you
need. For the complete and precise reference see the wicket-parent pom.xml in
the src/ folder.

 - wicket and wicket-extensions:

    You only need to include the Servlet API (2.5, just for compiling), SLF4J
    API and the SLF4J logging implementation you want. You cannot use Wicket
    without adding a SLF4J logging implementation to your classpath. Most
    people use log4j. If you do, just include slf4j-log4j12.jar on your
    classpath to get Wicket to use log4j too. If you want to use
    commons-logging or JDK14 logging or something else, please see the SLF4J
    site (http://www.slf4j.org/) for more information.

	As the following projects all depend on wicket, they inherit these
    dependencies.

 - wicket-datetime:

 	Joda-Time 1.6 (http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/)

 - wicket-velocity:

    Apache Velocity 1.7 (http://velocity.apache.org/) and it's dependencies
    (it ships a velocity-deps jar for convenience)

 - wicket-ioc:

    cglib nodep 2.1.3 (http://cglib.sourceforge.net/) and 
    asm 1.5.3 (http://asm.objectweb.org/)

 - wicket-spring:

    wicket-ioc and Spring (http://www.springframework.org/) and it's
    dependencies

 - wicket-guice:

    Google Guice (http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)

 - wicket-examples:

    All of the above.

Building Wicket from source
---------------------------

The Wicket distribution contains the final Wicket jar. You can use this
directly in your applications. The Wicket project also uploads the source 
and JavaDoc jars as well as the final jar to the Maven repository used by
the Maven build tool. So there is actually no specific need to build Wicket
yourself from the distribution.

Building using Maven 2 or 3, change the working directory to src and either
do:

 - mvn package

    creates wicket-x.y.z.jar in target/ subdirectory.

 - mvn install

    creates wicket-x.y.z.jar in target/ subdirectory and installs the file
    into your local Maven repository for use in other projects.

cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of
this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export
under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU)
exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for
both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

For encoding HTTP URL data (see org.apache.wicket.core.request.mapper.CryptoMapper)
Wicket requires the Java Cryptography extensions
(http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/security/). Wicket does not include
these libraries itself, but is designed to use them.
