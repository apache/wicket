      There are three means to configure Wickets configuration mode and they are
      tested in the order given. 
      1) A system property: -Dwicket.configuration
      2) servlet specific <init-param>
      3) context specific <context-param>
      The value might be either "development" (reloading when templates change)
      or "deployment". If no configuration is found, "deployment" is the default.
