Wicket's @<wicket:remove>@ tag can be very useful when our web designer needs to show us how a page or a panel should look like. The markup inside this tag will be stripped out in the final page, so it's the ideal place for web designers to put their stub markup:

{code:html}
<html>
<head>

</head>
<body>
	<wicket:remove>
	   <!-- Stub markup goes here -->
	</wicket:remove>
</body>
</html>
{code}
