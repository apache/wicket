The @Request@ and @Response@ classes are located in package @org.apache.wicket.request@ and they provide an abstraction of the concrete request and response used by our web application. 

Both classes are declared as abstract but if our application class inherits from @WebApplication@ it will use their sub classes @ServletWebRequest@ and @ServletWebResponse@, both of them located inside the package @org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.servlet.ServletWebRequest@ and @ServletWebResponse@ wrap respectively a @HttpServletRequest@ and a @HttpServletResponse@ object. If we need to access to these low-level objects we can call @Request@'s method @getContainerRequest()@ and @Response@'s method @getContainerResponse()@.
