Spring (and Guice) users can use standard "JSR-330":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330 annotations to wire their dependencies. This will make their code more interoperable with other containers that support this standard:

{code}
  //inject a bean specifying its name with JSR-330 annotations
  @Inject 
  @Named("anotherName")
  private EnterpriseMessage enterpriseMessage;
{code}
