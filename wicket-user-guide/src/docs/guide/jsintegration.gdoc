It's time to put into practice what we have learnt so far in this guide. To do this we will build a custom date component consisting of a text field to edit a date value and a fancy calendar icon to open a JavaScript datepicker. This chapter will also illustrate an example of integration of Wicket with a JavaScript library like "JQuery":http://jquery.com/ and its child project "JQuery UI":http://jqueryui.com/ .
