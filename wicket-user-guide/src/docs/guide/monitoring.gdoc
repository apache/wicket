The wicket-metrics module is available since Wicket 7.3.0 and contains a life measurement implementation to collect data of applications and visualize it.

You can see how many request your application served, how often components are created, initalized, configured or their detach method has been invoked and a lot of other additional information.

The module itself is using "Metrics of dropwizard":https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/ and "AspectJ":https://eclipse.org/aspectj/ so that if you turn of the measurement it has no longer any effect

to your web application.

Keep in mind that AspectJ is licensed under the Eclipse Public License and should provide the required license information.
