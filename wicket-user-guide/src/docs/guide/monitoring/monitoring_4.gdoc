There are only a two steps required to write own measurements for life data statistics in Wicket:

(1) Write a class which is named very close to what it measures. This class should extends WicketMetrics and should annotated with @Aspect and provide one method with a join point scanning for the target signature.
{code}
	@Aspect
	public class MySpecialAspect extends WicketMetrics
	{
		@Around("execution(* my.package.MyClass.myMethod(..))")
		public Object aroundRequestProcessed(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable
		{
			return measureTime("mycategory/someinformation/", joinPoint);
		}
	}
{code}
* To measure time you need @Around because measureTime of WicketMetrics requires the joinPoint - the class name is appended with a slash at the end

* To only mark that a method is called you can use mark of WicketMetrics and apply null as a second parameter - if you apply a join point to mark the class name is appended with a slash at the end

(2) Add the class to your aop.xml and of course the package to scan for classes that are target for your measurements:
{code}
<!DOCTYPE aspectj PUBLIC "-//AspectJ//DTD//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/dtd/aspectj.dtd">
<aspectj>
    <weaver options="-nowarn">
    	<include within="org.apache.wicket..*"/>
        <include within="my.package..*"/>
    </weaver>
    <aspects>
    	<aspect name="my.package.MySpecialAspect" />
    	<!-- wickets own metrics -->
    	.....
    </aspects>
</aspectj>
{code}
