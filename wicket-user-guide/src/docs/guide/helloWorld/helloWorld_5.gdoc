In this chapter we have seen the basic elements that compose a Wicket application. We have started preparing the configuration artifacts needed for our applications. As promised in [chapter 2.4|guide:helloWorld_4], we needed to put in place just a minimal amount of XML with an application class and a home page. 
Then we have continued our “first contact” with Wicket learning how to build a simple page with a label component as child. This example page has shown us how Wicket maps components to HTML tags and how it uses both of them to generate the final HTML markup. 
In the last paragraph we had a first taste of Wicket links and we have seen how they can be considered as a “click” event listener and how they can be used to navigate from a page to another.
