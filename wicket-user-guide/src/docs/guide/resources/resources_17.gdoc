In this chapter we have learnt how to manage resources with the built-in mechanism provided by Wicket. With this mechanism we handle resources from Java code and Wicket will automatically take care of generating a valid URL for them. We have also seen how resources can be bundled as package resources with a component that depends on them to make it self-contained.

Then, in the second part of the chapter, we have built a custom resource and we have learnt how to mount it to an arbitrary URL and how to make it globally available as shared resource.

Finally, in the last part of the paragraph we took a peek at the mechanism provided by the framework to customize the locations where the resource-lookup algorithm searches for resources.
