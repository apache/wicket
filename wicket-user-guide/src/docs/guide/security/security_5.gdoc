Wicket internally uses an entity called package resource guard to protect package resources from external access. This entity is an implementation of interface @org.apache.wicket.markup.html.IPackageResourceGuard@. 

By default Wicket applications use as package resource guard class @SecurePackageResourceGuard@, which allows to access only to the following file extensions (grouped by type):

{table}
File | Extensions
*JavaScript files* |.js
*CSS files* |.css
*HTML pages* |.html
*Textual files* |.txt
*Flash files* |.swf
*Picture files* |.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .ico, .cur, .bmp, .svg
*Web font files* |.eot, .ttf, .woff
{table}

To modify the set of allowed files formats we can add one or more patterns with method @addPattern(String)@. The rules to write a pattern are the following:

* patterns start with either a "+" or a "-". In the first case the pattern will add one or more file to the set while starting a pattern with a “-” we exclude all the files matching the given pattern. For example pattern “-web.xml” excludes all web.xml files in all directories.
* wildcard character “\*” is supported as placeholder for zero or more characters. For example  pattern “+\*.mp4” adds all the mp4 files inside all directories.
* subdirectories are supported as well. For example pattern “+documents/\*.pdf” adds all pdf files under “documents” directory. Character “\*” can be used with directories to specify a nesting level. For example “+documents/\*/\*.pdf” adds all pdf files placed one level below “documents” directory.
* a double wildcard character “\*\*” indicates zero or more subdirectories. For example pattern “+documents/\*\*/\*.pdf” adds all pdf files placed inside “documents” directory or inside any of its subdirectories.

Patterns that allow to access to every file with a given extensions (such as “+\*.pdf”) should be always avoided in favour of more restrictive expressions that contain a directory structure:

{code}
//Application class code...
@Override
public void init()   
{
      IPackageResourceGuard packageResourceGuard = application.getResourceSettings() 
                                                   .getPackageResourceGuard();
      if (packageResourceGuard instanceof SecurePackageResourceGuard)
      {
         SecurePackageResourceGuard guard = (SecurePackageResourceGuard) packageResourceGuard;
         //Allow to access only to pdf files placed in the “public” directory.
         guard.addPattern("+public/*.pdf");
      }
}
{code}
