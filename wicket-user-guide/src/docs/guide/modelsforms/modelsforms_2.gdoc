With Wicket 8 @IModel@ has been extended with new methods to fully leverage lambdas. The most interesting thing of the new version of @IModel@ is that it provides a default implementation for all of its methods (included @setObject()@), with the only exception of @getObject()@. 
In this way @IModel@ is eligible as functional interface and this greatly simplify the creation of custom models. As long as we need to display a static text it doesn't make much sense building a custom model, but if we need to display a dynamic value (like the input provided by a user or a value read from a database), defining a model with a lambda expression comes quite in handy.

Let's say we need a label to display the current time stamp each time a page is rendered. This could be a possible solution:

{code}
add(new Label("timeStamp", () -> java.time.LocalDate.now()));
{code}

As mentioned above, method @setObject()@ comes with a default implementation. The code is the following:
 
{code:java}
default void setObject(final T object)
{
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException(
    "Override this method to support setObject(Object)");
}
{code}

This means that models obtained using @IModel@ as lambda expressions are _read-only_. When we work with forms we need to use a model that support also data storing. In the next paragraph we will see a couple of models shipped with Wicket that allow us to easily use JavaBeans as backing objects.

Most of the default methods we find in @IModel@ are meant to leverage Lambda expressions to transform model object. The following is a short reference for such methods:

* *filter(predicate)*: Returns a @IModel@ checking whether the predicate holds for the contained object, if it is not null. If the predicate doesn't evaluate to true, the contained object will be null. Example:
    {divcontainer:li-nested-content}   
       {code:java}
//the filtered model will have a null model object if person's name 
//is not "Jane"
IModel<Person> janeModel = Model.of(person)
	.filter((p) -> p.getName().equals("Jane"));
       {code}
    {divcontainer}
* *map(mapperFunction)*: Returns a @IModel@ applying the given mapper to the contained object, if it is not null. Example:
    {divcontainer:li-nested-content}   
        {code:java}
//the new read-only model will contain the person's first name
IModel<String> personNameModel = Model.of(person).map(Person::getName);
        {code}
    {divcontainer}
* *flatMap(mapperFunction)*: Returns a @IModel@ applying the given @IModel@-bearing mapper to the contained object, if it is not null. Example:
	{divcontainer:li-nested-content}   
		{code:java}
//returns a read/write model for person's first name
//NOTE: LambdaModel will be discussed later.
IModel<String> personNameModel = Model.of(person).flatMap(targetPerson ->
LambdaModel.of(
	() -> targetPerson::getName, targetPerson::setName
));
		{code}
	{divcontainer}
 * *flatMap(otherModel, combiner)*: Returns a @IModel@ applying the given combining function to the current model object and to the one from the other model, if they are not null. Example:
    {divcontainer:li-nested-content}   
        {code:java}
IModel<String> hello = Model.of("hello");
IModel<String> world = Model.of("world");
IModel<String> combinedModel = hello.combineWith(
	world, (thisObj, otherObj) -> thisObj + " " + otherObj);

assertEquals("hello world", combinedModel.getObject());
        {code}
    {divcontainer}
 * *orElseGet(supplier)*:  Returns a read-only @IModel@ using either the contained object or invoking the given supplier to get a default value. Example:
    {divcontainer:li-nested-content}   
        {code:java}
IModel<String> nullObj = new Model();
assertEquals("hello!", nullObj.orElseGet(() -> "hello!");
        {code}
    {divcontainer}
