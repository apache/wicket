There was a time in the 90s when Internet was just a buzzword and watching a plain HTML page being rendered by a browser was a new and amazing experience. In those days we used to organize our page layout using the '<frame>' HTML tag. Over the years this tag has almost disappeared from our code and it survives only in few specific domains. For example is still being used by JavaDoc.

With the adoption of server side technologies like JSP, ASP or PHP the tag '<frame>' has been replaced by a template-based approach where we divide our page layout into some common areas that will be present in each page of our web application. Then, we manually insert these areas in every page including the appropriate markup fragments.

In this chapter we will see how to use Wicket to build a site layout. The sample layout we will use is a typical page layout consisting of the following areas:

* *a header* which could contain site title, some logos, a navigation bar, etc...  
* *a left* menu with a bunch of links to different areas/functionalities of the site. 
* *a footer* with generic informations like web master's email, the company address, etc...
* *a content* area which usually contains the functional part of the page.

The following picture summarises the layout structure:

Once we have chosen a page layout, our web designer can start building up the site theme. The result is a beautiful mock of our future web pages. Over this mock we can map the original layout areas:

Now in order to have a consistent layout across all the site, we must ensure that each page will include the layout areas seen above. With an old template-based approach we must manually put them inside every page. If we were using JSP we would probably end up using 'include' directive to add layout areas in our pages. We would have one 'include' for each of the areas (except for the content):

NOTE: For the sake of simplicity we can consider each included area as a static HTML fragment.

Now let's see how we can handle the layout of our web application using Wicket.
