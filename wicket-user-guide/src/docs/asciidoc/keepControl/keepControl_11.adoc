In this chapter we have seen the tools provided by Wicket to gain complete control over the generated HTML. However we didn't see yet how we can repeat a portion of HTML with Wicket. With classic server-side technologies like PHP or JSP we use loops (like _while_ or _for_) inside our pages to achieve this result. 
To perform this task Wicket provides a special-purpose family of components called repeaters and designed to repeat their markup body to display a set of items. 

But to fully understand how these components work, we must first learn more of Wicket's basics. That's why repeaters will be introduced later in 
<<displaying-multiple-items-with-repeaters,chapter 13>>.
