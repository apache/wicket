With the help of correct naming, you can easily identify the business aspects of a software component. Additionally good naming avoids unneccessary and bad comments.

Bad namings for Wicket-IDs are 'birthdateTextField', 'firstnameField' and 'addressPanel'. Why? The naming contains two aspects: A technical aspect (_ )[TextField] nd the business aspect (_ ).[birthdate] nly the the business aspect is relevant because both the HTML template as well as the Java code already contain the technical details ( ew[birthdate] "birthdate [)@)] dditionally, such names add a lot of effort when you do technical refactorings, e.g. if you have to replace a 'TextField' by a 'DatePicker' and the Wicket ID 'birthdateTextField' becomes 'birthdateDatePicker'. Another reason for avoiding technical aspects in Wicket IDs is the 'CompoundPropertyModel'. This model delegates the properties to its child components named by Wicket IDs (see listing 3). For example the 'TextField username' automatically calls 'setUsername()' and 'getUsername()' on the 'Registration' object. A setter like 'setUsernameTextfield()' would be very inconvenient here.
