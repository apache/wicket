Furthermore, there is a big community that answers complex questions very quickly. In Wicket it is very hard to document everything, because nearly everything is extensible and replaceable. If a component is not completely suitable, you will extend or replace it. Working with Wicket means permanently navigating through code. For example, just consider validators. How can I find all navigators that exist? Open the interface 'IValidator' (Eclipse: Ctrl + Shift + T) and then open the type hierachy (Crtl + T). Now we can see all the validators existing in Wicket and our project.
