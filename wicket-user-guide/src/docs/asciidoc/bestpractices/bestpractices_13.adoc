For example, a child component should have a matching wicket id in the markup. If the wicket id is not correctly bound - through a typo or if it was just forgotten - the test will fail. An advanced test could test a form, where a backend call gets executed and validated over a mock. So you can validate your component's behaviour. This is a simple way to detect and fix technical and business logic bugs during the build process. Wicket is very suitable for a test driven development approach. For instance, if you run a unit test which fails and shows a message that the wicket id not bound, you will avoid an unneccessary server startup (a server startup takes longer than running a unit test). This reduces the development turnaround. A disadvantage is the difficult testing possibility of AJAX components. However, the testing features of Wicket are much more sophisticated than in other web frameworks.
