In order to do this we can overwrite the Component's onDetach method that is called at the end of the current request. The following is the generic code of a component that uses two models:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * 
 * fooModel is used as main model while beeModel must be manually detached
 *
 */
public class ComponetTwoModels extends Component{

	private IModel<Bee> beeModel;

	public ComponetTwoModels(String id, IModel<Foo> fooModel, IModel<Bee> beeModel) {
		super(id, fooModel);
		this.beeModel = beeModel;
	}

	@Override
	public void onDetach() {
               if(beeModel != null)
	   beeModel.detach();
             
              super.onDetach();
	}
}
----

When we overwrite onDetach we must call the super class implementation of this method, usually as last line in our custom implementation.
