Since the development of many web applications is mostly based on the Spring framework for dependency injection and application configuration in general, it's especially important to get these two frameworks running together smoothly not only when deployed on a running server instance itself but rather during the execution of JUnit based integration tests as well. Thanks to the _WicketTester_ API provided by the Wicket framework itself, one can easily build high-quality web applications while practicing test driven development and providing a decent set of unit and integration tests to be executed with each build. As already mentioned previously, integration and configuration of our web applications is based on a lightweight Spring container meaning that the integration of Spring's _ApplicationContext_ and a WicketTester API is essential to get our integration tests running. In order to explain how to achieve that integration in an easy and elegant fashion in your integration test environment, we'll first take a look at a configuration of these 2 framework beauties in a runtime environment.
