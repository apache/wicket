The first decade of 2000s has seen the rising of new frameworks (like "Spring":http://spring.io/ ) and new specifications (like "EJB 3.1":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans ) aimed to simplify the management of enterprise resources and (among other things) their integration with presentation code. 

All these new technologies are based on the concepts of container and dependency injection. Container is the environment where our enterprise resources are created and configured while  "dependency injection":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection is a pattern implemented by containers to inject into an object the resources it depends on.

Wicket can be easily integrated with enterprise containers using component instantiation listeners. These entities are instances of interface 'org.apache.wicket.application.IComponentInstantiationListener' and can be registered during application's initialization.   IComponentInstantiationListener defines callback method onInstantiation(Component component) which can be used to provide custom instantiation logic for Wicket components. 

Wicket distribution and project "WicketStuff":https://github.com/wicketstuff already provide a set of built-in listeners to integrate our applications with EJB 3.1 compliant containers (like JBoss Seam) or with some of the most popular enterprise frameworks like "Guice":http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ or Spring.

In this chapter we will see two basic examples of injecting a container-defined object into a page using first an implementation of the EJB 3.1 specifications (project "OpenEJB":http://openejb.apache.org/ ) and then using Spring.
