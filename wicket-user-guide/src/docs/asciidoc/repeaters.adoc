With the old template-based technologies (like JSP) we used to accomplish this task using classic for or while loops:

[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>
  <%
    for(int i = 12; i<=32; i++) {
      %>
      <div>Hello! I'm index n°<%= %></div>
  <% 
    }
  %>
</body>
----

To ease this task Wicket provides a number of special-purpose components called repeaters which are designed to use their related markup to display the items of a given set in a more natural and less chaotic way.

In this chapter we will see some of the built-in repeaters that come with Wicket.
