Once you call _queue()_, when are the components dequeued into the page hierarchy? When is it safe to call _getParent()_ or use methods such as _isVisibleInHierarchy()_ which rely on componentâ€™s position in hierarchy?

The components are dequeued as soon as a path is available from _Page_ to the component they are queued into. The dequeue operation needs access to markup which is only available once the Page is known (because the _Page_ object controls the extension of the markup).

If the _Page_ is known at the time of the _queue()_ call (eg if its called inside _onInitialize()_) the components are dequeued before _queue()_ returns.
