=== Ancestors

Suppose on a user profile panel we have the following code:

[source,java]
----
queue(new Label("first"));
queue(new Label("last"));
 
WebMarkupContainer secure=new WebMarkupContainer("secure") {
    void onConfigure() {
       super.onConfigure();
       setVisible(isViewingOwnProfile());
    }
};
 
queue(secure);
secure.queue(new Label("creditCardNumber"));
secure.queue(new Label("creditCardExpiry"));
----

What is to prevent someone with access to markup from moving the _creditCardNumber_ label out of the _secure_ div, causing a big security problem for the site?

Wicket will only dequeue components either to the component they are queued to or any of its descendants.

In the code above this is the reason why we queued the _creditCardNumber_ label into the _secure_ container. That means it can only be dequeued into the _secure_ containerâ€™s hierarchy.

This restriction allows developers to enforce certain parent-child relationships in their code.

=== Regions

Dequeuing of components will not happen across components that implement the _org.apache.wicket.IQueueRegion_ interface. This interface is implemented by all components that provide their own markup such as: _Page_, _Panel_, _Border_, _Fragment_. This is done so that if both a page and panel contain a component with id _foo_ the one queued into the page will not be dequeued into the panel. This minimizes confusion and debugging time. The rule so far is that if a component provides its own markup only components queued inside it will be dequeued into it.
