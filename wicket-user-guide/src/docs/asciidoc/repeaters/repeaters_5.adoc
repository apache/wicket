Then, we have seen components 'ListView' and 'RefreshingView' which should be used when the markup to repeat contains nested components to populate. 

Finally, we have discussed those repeaters that support data paging and that are called pageable repeaters. We ended the chapter looking at an example where a pageable repeater is used with panel PagingNavigator to make its dataset navigable by the user.
