Spring (and Guice) users can use standard  http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330[JSR-330] annotations to wire their dependencies. This will make their code more interoperable with other containers that support this standard:

[source,java]
----
  //inject a bean specifying its name with JSR-330 annotations
  @Inject 
  @Named("anotherName")
  private EnterpriseMessage enterpriseMessage;
----
