Just like pageable repeaters (seen in  <<guide:repeaters_4,paragraph 13.4>>
) DataGrid provides data pagination and uses interface IDataProvider as data source. In addition the component is completely ajaxified:

DataGrid supports also editable cells and row selection:

The following snippet illustrate how to use DataGrid and is taken from wiki page  https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/InMethodGrid[https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/InMethodGrid]  

*HTML:*

[source,html]
----
...
  <div wicket:id="grid">Grid</div>
... 
----

*Java code:*

[source,java]
----
final List<Person> personList = //load a list of Persons
final ListDataProvider listDataProvider = new ListDataProvider(personList);
//define grid's columns
List<IGridColumn> cols = (List) Arrays.asList(
	     new PropertyColumn(new Model("First Name"), "firstName"),
	     new PropertyColumn(new Model("Last Name"), "lastName"));

DataGrid grid = new DefaultDataGrid("grid", new DataProviderAdapter(listDataProvider), cols);
add(grid);
----

In the code above we have used convenience class DefaultDataGrid that is a subclass of DataGrid and it already comes with a navigation toolbar.
