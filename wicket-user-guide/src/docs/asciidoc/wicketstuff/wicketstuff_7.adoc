In this case an obvious solution would be to roll out our own stateless components/behaviors, but Wicketstuff alredy offers such kind of artifacts with 'stateless' module. Here you can find the stateless version of the basic AJAX componets and behaviors shiped with Wicket, like 'StatelessAjaxSubmitLink', 'StatelessAjaxFallbackLink', 'StatelessAjaxEventBehavior', 'StatelessAjaxFormSubmitBehavior' etc...
A short introduction to this module can be found on its "home page":https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/master/jdk-1.7-parent/stateless-parent .
