Wicket makes working with AJAX easy and pleasant with its component-oriented abstraction. However as side effect, AJAX components and behaviors make their hosting page stateful. This can be quite annoying if we are working on a page that must be stateless (for example a login page). 
In this case an obvious solution would be to roll out our own stateless components/behaviors, but Wicketstuff alredy offers such kind of artifacts with _stateless_ module. Here you can find the stateless version of the basic AJAX componets and behaviors shiped with Wicket, like _StatelessAjaxSubmitLink_, _StatelessAjaxFallbackLink_, _StatelessAjaxEventBehavior_, _StatelessAjaxFormSubmitBehavior_ etc...
A short introduction to this module can be found on its  https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/master/jdk-1.7-parent/stateless-parent[home page] .
