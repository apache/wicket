This chapter will cover the built-in support for testing provided by Wicket with its rich set of helper and mock classes that allows us to test our components and our applications in isolation (i.e without the need for a servlet container) using JUnit, the de facto standard for Java unit testing. 

In this chapter we will see how to write unit tests for our applications and components and we will learn how to use helper classes to simulate user navigation and write acceptance tests without the need of any testing framework other than JUnit.

The JUnit version used in this chapter is 4.x.
