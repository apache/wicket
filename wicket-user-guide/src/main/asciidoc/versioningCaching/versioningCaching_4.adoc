In this chapter we have seen how page instances are managed by Wicket. We have learnt that pages can be divided into two families: stateless and stateful pages. Knowing the difference between the two types of pages is important to build the right page for a given task. 

However, to complete the discussion about stateless pages we still have to deal with two topics we have just outlined in this chapter: class PageParameters and bookmarkable pages. The first part of 
<<_wicket_links_and_url_generation,chapter 10>> will cover these missing topics.
