Visibility of components is an important topic. In Wicket you control any component's visibility via the methodsÂ _isVisible()_ and _setVisible()_. These methods are within Wicket's base class _Component_ and therefore it is applicable for every component and page. Let's have a look at a concrete example of _LoginBoxPanel_. The panel just gets displayed when the user is not logged in.

*Listing 6:*

[source,java]
----
// Poor implementation
LoginBoxPanel loginBox = new LoginBoxPanel("login");
loginBox.setVisible(MySession.get().isNotLoggedIn());
add(loginBox);
----

Listing 6 shows a poor implementation, because a decision about the visibility is made while instanciating the component. Again, in Wicket instances of components exist for several requests.

To reuse the same instance you have to call _loginBox.setVisible(false)_. This is very unhandy, because we always have to call _setVisible()_ and manage the visibility manually from the outside.

This approach is error-prone and fragile, because we always have to pay attention to setting the correct information every time. But this is often forgotten because the logic might be widely spread over the code.

The solution is the Hollywood principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you". Take a look at the following diagram illustrating an application flow with some calls. We avoid three calls through the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Principle[Hollywood-Principle] and we just have to instantiate the _LoginBoxPanel_.

*Listing 7:*

[source,java]
----
public class LoginBoxPanel {
    // constructor etc.
    @Override
    public void onConfigure() {
        setVisible(MySession.get().isNotLoggedIn());
    }
};
----

Now the control over visibility has been inverted, the _LoginBoxPanel_ decides on its visibility autonomously.

For each call of _onConfigure()_ there is a refreshed interpretion of the login state. Hence, there is no additional state that might be outdated. The logic is centralized in one line code and not spread throughout the application. Furthermore, you can easily identify that the technical aspect of visibility correlates to the business aspect "logged in".

TIP: The same approach can be used to control when a component is enabled.

NOTE: Forms which are within an inactive or invisible component do not get executed.

Note that there are cases in which calls to _setVisible()_ and _setEnabled()_ seem unavoidable. For example, the user presses a button to display an inlined registration form. In general, you can apply the following rules: data driven components are configured by their model, and the button modifies the model. Listing 8 presents a model-bound visibility.

*Listing 8:*

[source,java]
----
new Label("headline", headlineModel) {
    @Override
    public void onConfigure() {
        // Headline visible only if text starts with "Berlusconi"
        String headline = getModelObject();
        setVisible(headline.startWith("Berlusconi"));
    }
}
----

WARNING: While possible, overriding _isVisible()_ may lead to unpredictable results under some conditions.
