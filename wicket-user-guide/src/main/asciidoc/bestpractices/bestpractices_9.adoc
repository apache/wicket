Validators should just validate. Consider a bank account form which has a _BankFormValidator_. This validator checks the bank data over a webservice and corrects the bank name. Nobody would expect that a validator modifies information. Such logic has to be located in _Form.onSubmit()_ or in the event logic of a button.
