As we have seen in <<forms2.adoc#_form_validation_and_feedback_messages,paragraph 12.2>>, the infrastructure of feedback messages is built on top of Java internationalization (i18n) support, so it should not be surprising that the same infrastructure is used also for localization purpose. However, while so far we have used only the <ApplicationClassName>.properties file to store our custom messages, in this chapter we will see that also pages, components, validators and even Java packages can have their own resource bundles. This allows us to split bundles into multiple files keeping them close to where they are used. But before diving into the details of internationalization with Wicket, it's worthwhile to quickly review how i18n works under Java, see what classes are involved and how they are integrated into Wicket.

NOTE: Providing a full description of Java support for i18n is clearly out of the scope of this document. If you need more informations about this topic you can find them in the JavaDocs and in the official  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/index.html[i18n tutorial] .

=== Class Locale and ResourceBundle

Class java.util.Locale represents a specific country or language of the world and is used in Java to retrieve other locale-dependent informations like numeric and date formats, the currency in use in a country and so on. Such kind of informations are accessed through special entities called resource bundles which are implemented by class _java.util.ResourceBundle_. Every resource bundle is identified by a full name which is built using four parameters: a base name (which is required), a language code, a country code and a variant (which are all optional). These three optional parameters are provided by an instance of Locale with its three corresponding getter methods: getLanguage(), getCountry() and getVariant(). Parameter language code is a lowercase ISO 639 2-letter code (like zh for Chinese, de for German and so on) while country code is an uppercase ISO 3166 2-letter code (like CN for China, DE for Germany and so on). The final full name will have the following structure (NOTE: tokens inside squared brackets are optional):

[source,java]
----
<base name>[_<language code>[_<COUNTRY_CODE>[_<variant code>]]]
----

For example a bundle with MyBundle as base name and localized for Mandarin Chinese (language code zh, country code CH, variant cmn) will have MyBundle_zh_CH_cmn as full name. A base name can be a fully qualified class name, meaning that it can include a package name before the actual base name. The specified package will be the container of the given bundle. For example if we use org.foo.MyBundle as base name, the bundle named MyBundle will be searched inside package org.foo. The actual base name (MyBundle in our example) will be used to build the full name of the bundle following the same rules seen above.
_ResourceBundle_ is an abstract factory class, hence it exposes a number of factory methods named  getBundle to load a concrete bundle. Without going into too much details we can say that a bundle corresponds to a file in the classpath. To find a file for a given bundle, getBundle needs first to generate an ordered list of candidate bundle names. These names are the set of all possible full names for a given bundle. For example if we have org.foo.MyBundle as base name and the current locale is the one seen before for Mandarin Chinese, the candidate names will be:

1. org.foo.MyBundle_zh_CH_cmn
2. org.foo.MyBundle_zh_CH
3. org.foo.MyBundle_zh
4. org.foo.MyBundle

The list of these candidate names is generated starting from the most specific one and subtracting an optional parameter at each step. The last name of the list corresponds to the default resource bundle which is the most general name and is equal to the base name. Once that getBundle has generated the list of candidate names, it will iterate over them to find the first one for which is possible to load a class or a properties file. The class must be a subclass of _ResourceBundle_ having as class name the full name used in the current iteration. If such a class is not found, getBundle will try to locate a properties file having a file name equals to the current full name (Java will automatically append extension .properties to the full name). For example given the resource bundle of the previous example, Java will search first for class org.foo.MyBundle_zh_CH_cmn and then for file MyBundle_zh_CH_cmn.properties inside package org.foo. If no file is found for any of the candidate names, a MissingResourceException will be thrown. Bundles contains local-dependent string resources identified by a key that is unique in the given bundle. So once we have obtained a valid bundle we can access these objects with method getString (String key).

As we have seen before working with feedback messages, in Wicket most of the times we will work with properties files rather than with bundle classes. In <<forms2.adoc#_form_validation_and_feedback_messages,paragraph 12.2>> we used a properties file having as base name the class name of the application class and without any information about the locale. This file is the default resource bundle for a Wicket application. In <<i18n.adoc#_bundles_lookup_algorithm,paragraph 15.3>> we will explore the algorithm used in Wicket to locate the available bundles for a given component. Once we have learnt how to leverage this algorithm, we will be able to split our bundles into more files organized in a logical hierarchy.
