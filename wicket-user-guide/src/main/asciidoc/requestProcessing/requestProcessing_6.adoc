In this chapter we had a look at how Wicket internally handles a web request. Even if most of the time  we won't need to customize this internal process, knowing how it works is essential to use the framework at 100%.

Entities like Application and Session will come in handy again when we will tackle the topic of security in 
<<_security_with_wicket,chapter 23>>.
