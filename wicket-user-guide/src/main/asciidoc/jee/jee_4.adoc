During their lifecycle Wicket components are serialized into the session or some secondary storage.
But in most cases injected dependencies are not serializable, as these are typically singletons like services and repositories.
Because of this Wicket uses https://bytebuddy.net/#/[Byte Buddy] to generate proxies that are injected instead.
These will serialize a replacement and re-lookup the dependency after deserialization.

NOTE: By default injected types need a default constructor without arguments, otherwise proxies can not be instantiated.
You can remedy this limitation by adding http://objenesis.org[Objenesis] to your project depencencies.


In this chapter we have seen how to integrate Wicket applications with Spring and with an EJB container. Module wicket-examples contains also an example of integration with Guice (see application class _org.apache.wicket.examples.guice.GuiceApplication_).
