_CryptoMapper_ helps preventing CSRF attacks by making the urls impossible to be guessed by an attacker but still there is some theoretical chance this to happen.

To further help against this kind of vulnerability Wicket provides _CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener_ - a _IRequestCycleListener_ that forbids requests made from a different origin. By default only actions are forbidden, i.e. a request coming from different origin cannot execute _Link1.onClick()_ or submit forms (_Form1.onSubmit()_). Any request to render pages are still allowed so Wicket pages could be easily embedded in other applications.

MyApplication.java
[source,java]
----
  @Override
 protected void init() {
  super.init();
  getRequestCycleListeners().add(new CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener());
  // ...
 }
----

_CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener_ is highly configurable. It allows to define a whitelist of allowed origins via _addAcceptedOrigin(String acceptedOrigin)_, to enable/disable it dynamically by overriding _isEnabled()_, to define different kind of actions when a request is rejected or allowed, to set custom error message and code for the rejected requests.

_CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener_ is not an alternative to _CryptoMapper_! Both of them could be used separately or in tandem to prevent CSRF attacks depending on the application requirements.
