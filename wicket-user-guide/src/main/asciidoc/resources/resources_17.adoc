Another way to receive external image resources is to use the corresponding component with a model which contains the target URL. 

The ExternalImage and ExternalSource components which are available since Wicket 7.2.0 / Wicket 8.0.0 fulfill that task.

The following example demonstrates the usage of a CompoundPropertyModel with the model object  [ImageSrc] The model object, bound to surrounding component / page, contains an attribute named  [url] which is read by the component:

Java:
[source,java]
----
ImageSrc imageSrc = new ImageSrc();
imageSrc.setUrl("http://www.google.de/test.jpg");
setDefaultModel(new CompoundPropertyModel<>(imageSrc));
add(new ExternalImage("url"));
----

HTML:
[source,java]
----
<img wicket:id="url" />
----

The ExternalImage can also be constructed by passing in a Model (src) and Model of List (srcSet). For ExternalSource only the srcSet is available.
