Starting from version 6.15.0 we can specify where header contributors must be rendered inside <head> tag using the placeholder tag _<wicket:header-items/>_: 

[source,html]
----
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
  <wicket:header-items/>
  <script src="my-monkey-patch-of-wicket-ajax.js"></script>
</head>
----

With the code above all header contributions done by using IHeaderResponse in your Java code or the special _<wicket:head>_ tag will be put between the <meta> and <script> elements, i.e. in the place of _<wicket:header-items/>_.

This way you can make sure that some header item is always before or after the header items managed by Wicket.

_<wicket:header-items/>_ can be used only in the page's <head> element and there could be at most one instance of it.
