Panel's markup can also contain HTML tags which must go inside header section of the final page, like tags _<script>_ or _<style>_. To tell Wicket to put these tags inside page _<head>_, we must surround them with the _<wicket:head>_ tag.

Considering the markup of a generic panel, we can use _<wicket:head>_ tag in this way:

[source,html]
----
<wicket:head>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	  	function myPanelFunction(){
	  	}
	  </script>
	
	<style>
        .myPanelClass{
	  	font-weight: bold;
	  	color: red;
	  }	 
       </style>
</wicket:head>
<body>
	<wicket:panel>

	</wicket:panel>
</body>	
----

Wicket will take care of placing the content of _<wicket:head>_ inside the _<head>_ tag of the final page.

NOTE: The _<wicket:head>_ tag can also be used with children pages/panels which extend parent markup using tag _<wicket:extend>_.

NOTE: The content of the _<wicket:head>_ tag is added to the header section once per component class. In other words, if we add multiple instances of the same panel to a page, the _<head>_ tag will be populated just once with the content of _<wicket:head>_.

WARNING: The _<wicket:head>_ tag is ideal if we want to define small in-line blocks of CSS or JavaScript. However Wicket provides also a more sophisticated technique to let components contribute to header section with in-line blocks and resource files like CSS or JavaScript files. We will see this technique later in 
<<_resource_management_with_wicket,chapter 16>>.
