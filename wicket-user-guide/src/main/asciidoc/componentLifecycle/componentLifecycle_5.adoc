This stage is entered when a component is removed from its container hierarchy. The only hook method for this phase is _onRemove()_. If our component still holds some resources needed during rendering phase, we can override this method to release them.

Once a component has been removed we are free to add it again to the same container or to a different one. Wicket offers a further hook method called _onReAdd()_ which is triggered every time a previously removed component is re-added to a container.
Please note that while _onInitialize()_ is called only the very first time a component is added, _onReAdd()_ is called every time it is re-added after having been removed.
