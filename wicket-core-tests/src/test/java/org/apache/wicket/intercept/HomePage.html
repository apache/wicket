      <h1>Quickstart</h1>
      <p>This quickstart illustrates a bug where the InterceptData is never cleared.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 1 - Intercepted Login</h2>
      <p>
        This link goes to Secure Page, which requires login. You should see the login page, followed
        by Secure Page upon successful login. This is accomplished with
        RestartResponseAtInterceptPageException, which places InterceptData in the Session.
        The Login page then calls continueToOriginalDestination().
      </p>
      <p>Click:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="SecurePage.html">Secure Page via Login</a></blockquote>
    
      <h2>Step 2 - Explicit Login</h2>
      <p>
        This link goes directly to the login page. Since no RestartResponseAtInterceptPageException
        is used, and since the previous InterceptData should have been cleared by now, the
        continueToOriginalDestination() on the Login page will return false. This branch of the
        code should send you to the Success page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However due to a bug, the InterceptData is apparently never cleared.</strong>
        Therefore the Success page is never reached. Instead, you will be sent to Secure Page because
        the InterceptData from step 1 is still in the Session.
      </p>
      <p>Click:</p>
