/**
 * Runs a block of code periodically. A <code>Task</code> can be started at a given time in the
 * future and can be a daemon. The block of code will be passed a <code>Log</code> object each time
 * it is run through its <code>ICode</code> interface.
 * <p>
 * If the code block takes longer than the period to run, the next task invocation will occur
 * immediately. In this case, tasks will not occur at precise multiples of the period. For example,
 * if you run a task every 30 seconds, and the first run takes 40 seconds but the second takes 20
 * seconds, your task will be invoked at 0 seconds, 40 seconds and 70 seconds (40 seconds + 30
 * seconds), which is not an even multiple of 30 seconds.
 * <p>
 * In general, this is a simple task class designed for polling activities. If you need precise
 * guarantees, you probably should be using a different task class.
