              Apache Commons FileUpload 1.3.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons FileUpload team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons FileUpload 1.3.1.

The Apache Commons FileUpload component provides a simple yet flexible means of
adding support for multipart file upload functionality to servlets and web
applications. Version 1.3 onwards requires Java 5 or later.

No client code changes are required to migrate from version 1.3.0 to 1.3.1.


This is a security and maintenance release that includes an important security
fix as well as a small number of bugfixes.

Changes in version 1.3.1 include:


Fixed Bugs:
o                  SECURITY - CVE-2014-0050. Specially crafted input can trigger a DoS if the
                   buffer used by the MultipartStream is not big enough. When constructing
                   MultipartStream enforce the requirements for buffer size by throwing an
                   IllegalArgumentException if the requested buffer size is too small. This
                   prevents the DoS.
o                  When deserializing DiskFileItems ensure that the repository location, if
                   any, is a valid one. Thanks to Arun Babu Neelicattu.
o                  Correct example in usage documentation so it compiles.
